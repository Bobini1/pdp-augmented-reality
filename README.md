To open the screen, camera and audio sharing application, run pdp-augmented-reality\Desktop Application\apache-tomcat-9.0.68\bin\startup.bat,
open the browser and go to localhost:8080/engiee.

To modify the application, open part of the program you want to modify (e.g. pdp-augmented-reality\Desktop Application\EngieeCamera) as a project in
IDE (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA), apply your changes and generate WAR file. Paste generated WAR file to
pdp-augmented-reality\Desktop Application\apache-tomcat-9.0.68\webapps and give it a proper name (corresponding to the address of the part of the
program - # means /).
